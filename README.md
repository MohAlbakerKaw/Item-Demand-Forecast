# Item-Demand-Forecast

Item-Demand forecasting plays a critical role in inventory management. When you can accurately predict the market demand, you can take action to ensure you hold the correct stock to maximize sales and profit. This post will touch on the DeepAR forecast algorithm for the mentioned objective and list the best practices.

DeepAR: 
Founded by the Amazon research team, the approach helps predict the future probability distribution of a time series based on the given past.
DeepAR forecasting algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm for forecasting scalar time series using autoregressive recurrent networks. 
The training input for the DeepAR algorithm is one or more, target time series that have been generated by similar processes.

Best Practices for using DeepAR:
Don't break up the time series or provide only a part of it. You should be very aware of how to eliminate outliers when detected.<br>
Evaluate the model on unseen data. 
Avoid large values for prediction length. (if far future forecast needed, consider data aggregation)
Use the same value for context length as prediction length.
DeepAR requires that the total number of observations available across all training time series is at least 300.
